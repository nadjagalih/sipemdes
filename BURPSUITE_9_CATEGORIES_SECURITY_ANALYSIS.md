# BURP SUITE SECURITY VULNERABILITIES ANALYSIS REPORT
**SIPEMDES Application - Security Assessment Results**

## Executive Summary
Based on the analysis of the SIPEMDES application codebase, I have identified security vulnerabilities corresponding to the 9 categories found in the Burp Suite pentest report. This report details the findings for each category with specific locations and recommendations.

---

## 1. TLS Cookie Without Secure Flag Set

### **STATUS: CRITICAL VULNERABILITY FOUND** ⚠️

#### Issue Description
The application has inconsistent cookie security configuration that could allow session hijacking over unencrypted connections.

#### Findings:
- **File:** `config/app_config.php` (Line 41)
  ```php
  'cookie_secure' => false, // Set to true for HTTPS
  ```
  This setting explicitly disables the secure flag for cookies.

- **File:** `Module/Security/SecurityHeaders.php` (Lines 93-97)
  ```php
  session_set_cookie_params([
      'lifetime' => 3600,
      'path' => '/',
      'domain' => '',
      'secure' => true, // Always secure in production
      'httponly' => true,
      'samesite' => 'Strict'
  ]);
  ```
  While this sets secure to true, the config setting may override it.

#### Risk Level: **HIGH**
#### Impact: Session hijacking, credential theft

#### Recommendation:
1. Set `'cookie_secure' => true` in `config/app_config.php`
2. Ensure all production environments force HTTPS
3. Add environment detection to automatically enable secure cookies

## 2. Vulnerable JavaScript Dependencies

### **STATUS: VULNERABILITIES DETECTED** ⚠️

#### Issue Description
The application uses several JavaScript libraries that may contain known security vulnerabilities.

#### Findings:
- **jQuery 3.7.1:** Used in `/Vendor/Assets/js/jquery-3.7.1.min.js`
  - Generally secure, but check for latest updates
  
- **External CDN Dependencies:**
  - Font Awesome: `https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.15.4/css/all.css`
  - Leaflet Maps: `https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js`
  - SweetAlert: `https://unpkg.com/sweetalert/dist/sweetalert.min.js`
  - Bootstrap and various plugins

#### Risk Level: **MEDIUM**
#### Impact: XSS attacks, code injection

#### Recommendation:
1. Audit all JavaScript dependencies for known CVEs
2. Update to latest secure versions
3. Consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external scripts
4. Host critical libraries locally instead of using CDNs

---

## 3. Strict Transport Security Not Enforced

### **STATUS: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** ⚠️

#### Issue Description
HSTS implementation is conditional and may not be enforced in all scenarios.

#### Findings:
- **File:** `Module/Security/SecurityHeaders.php` (Lines 22-24)
  ```php
  if (isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && $_SERVER['HTTPS'] === 'on') {
      header('Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload');
  }
  ```
  HSTS only set when HTTPS is already active.

- **File:** `Module/Security/SecurityHeaders.php` (Lines 58-62)
  ```php
  if (!self::isDevelopmentMode()) {
      header('Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload');
  }
  ```
  Better implementation but still conditional.

#### Risk Level: **MEDIUM**
#### Impact: Man-in-the-middle attacks, protocol downgrade attacks

#### Recommendation:
1. Always send HSTS headers in production
2. Implement proper HTTPS redirect before setting HSTS
3. Consider shorter max-age initially, then increase

---

## 4. Cross-Site Request Forgery

### **STATUS: PARTIALLY PROTECTED** ✅⚠️

#### Issue Description
CSRF protection is implemented but not consistently applied across all forms.

#### Findings:
**Protected Forms:**
- User management forms with `CSRFProtection::getTokenField()`
- Authentication forms in `AuthKabupaten/SignIn.php`, `AuthKecamatan/SignIn.php`, `AuthDesa/SignIn.php`

**Potentially Unprotected Forms:**
- Several report generation forms missing CSRF tokens
- File upload forms may lack proper protection
- Example: `View/UserKecamatan/Report/Pensiun/ViewMasaPensiunKades.php` (Line 72)

#### Risk Level: **MEDIUM**
#### Impact: Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of users

#### Recommendation:
1. Implement CSRF protection on ALL forms
2. Add server-side validation in all form processors
3. Review AJAX requests for CSRF protection

---

## 5. Cross-Domain Script Include

### **STATUS: MULTIPLE EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES** ⚠️

#### Issue Description
Application loads resources from multiple external domains without proper security controls.

#### Findings:
**External Resources:**
- `use.fontawesome.com` - Font Awesome CSS
- `unpkg.com` - Leaflet maps, SweetAlert
- `fonts.googleapis.com` - Google Fonts
- `fonts.gstatic.com` - Font files

**Files containing external includes:**
- `View/UserKecamatan/ProfileKecamatan/SettingProfile.php`
- `View/UserKecamatan/Dashboard/AdminKecamatan.php`
- `View/Desa/DesaEdit.php`
- `main.php`

#### Risk Level: **HIGH**
#### Impact: Supply chain attacks, data theft, XSS

#### Recommendation:
1. Host critical resources locally
2. Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI)
3. Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict external domains
4. Regularly audit external dependencies

---

## 6. Frameable Response (Potential Clickjacking)

### **STATUS: PROTECTED** ✅

#### Issue Description
Application implements clickjacking protection but worth monitoring.

#### Findings:
- **File:** `Module/Security/SecurityHeaders.php` (Lines 14, 49)
  ```php
  header('X-Frame-Options: DENY');
  ```
  Proper X-Frame-Options implementation.

#### Risk Level: **LOW**
#### Impact: Minimal risk due to proper implementation

#### Recommendation:
1. Consider adding CSP `frame-ancestors 'none'` as additional protection
2. Test with modern browsers to ensure effectiveness

---

## 7. Email Addresses Disclosed

### **STATUS: MULTIPLE EXPOSURES FOUND** ⚠️

#### Issue Description
Email addresses are exposed in various locations, potentially revealing system information.

#### Findings:
**Application Code:**
- Form placeholders: `user@example.com` in multiple employee forms
- Vendor libraries contain developer emails: `info@tecnick.com`, `webmaster@html2pdf.fr`

**Specific Locations:**
- `View/PegawaiBPD/PegawaiBPDAdd.php` (Line 121)
- `View/Pegawai/PegawaiEdit.php` (Line 141)
- `View/AdminDesa/Pegawai/PegawaiEdit.php` (Line 125)
- Vendor directory contains multiple email addresses

#### Risk Level: **LOW to MEDIUM**
#### Impact: Information disclosure, potential phishing targets

#### Recommendation:
1. Replace specific email examples with generic placeholders
2. Review vendor libraries for sensitive information
3. Implement email obfuscation where necessary

---

## 8. TLS Certificate

### **STATUS: CONFIGURATION DEPENDENT** ⚠️

#### Issue Description
TLS certificate handling depends on server configuration, not application-level controls.

#### Findings:
- No explicit certificate validation in application code
- HTTPS enforcement implemented but server-dependent
- No certificate pinning or additional validation

#### Risk Level: **MEDIUM**
#### Impact: Man-in-the-middle attacks if certificates are compromised

#### Recommendation:
1. Implement proper certificate validation in any cURL operations
2. Use HSTS preloading
3. Consider certificate pinning for critical connections
4. Regular certificate monitoring and renewal

---

## 9. Mixed Content

### **STATUS: LIMITED MIXED CONTENT FOUND** ⚠️

#### Issue Description
Some HTTP resources may be loaded on HTTPS pages, primarily in vendor libraries.

#### Findings:
- **File:** `Vendor/html2pdf/vendor/tecnickcom/tcpdf/tcpdf.php` (Line 6832)
  Contains reference to HTTP image URLs in documentation
- Vendor examples contain HTTP links but these aren't active in production
- Most application resources use relative paths (good practice)

#### Risk Level: **LOW**
#### Impact: Content blocking, security warnings

#### Recommendation:
1. Ensure all external resources use HTTPS
2. Implement CSP to block mixed content
3. Review vendor libraries for HTTP references
4. Use protocol-relative URLs where appropriate
